# Gesture Recognition Magic Wand

This is a gesture recognition magic wand that I built as part of a Harry Potter costume for Halloween 2018. The wand detects W (wingardium leviosa) and spiral (flippendo) gestures as inspired by the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone computer game. 

This repo includes the code and Python notebooks used to train the gesture recognition machine learning models and some basic sample data. It is a good beginner machine learning project. If you replicate this project, definitely collect new sample data. There is a lot of opportunity to improve the models.
